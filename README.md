# Project Title

## Overview
This project implements various image classification models using TensorFlow, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and MaxViT. The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework for training and evaluating these models on image datasets.

## Models
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: A model that utilizes self-attention mechanisms for image classification.
- **Swin Transformer**: A hierarchical transformer that computes representations with shifted windows.
- **MaxViT**: A model that combines the strengths of both ViT and CNNs for improved performance.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation
Data should be organized in a directory structure suitable for image classification. Use the `load_data` function from `data/preprocess.py` to load and preprocess the data.

## Training
To train the models, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir <path_to_data> --model <model_name>
```
Replace `<model_name>` with either `vit`, `swin`, or `maxvit`.

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model's performance using:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model <model_name>
```

## Metrics
The project includes functions to calculate various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and confusion matrix, located in `utils/metrics.py`.

## Visualization
Visualize training history and results using the functions in `utils/visualization.py`.
